/* server/init.JSON
** You must write a script that will create documents in your database according
** to the datamodel you have defined for the application.  Remember that you 
** must at least initialize an admin user account whose credentials are derived
** from command-line arguments passed to this script. But, you should also add
** some communities, posts, comments, and link-flairs to fill your application
** some initial content.  You can use the initializeDB.js script as inspiration, 
** but you cannot just copy and paste it--you script has to do more to handle
** users.
